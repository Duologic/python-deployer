deployer.contrib
================

This contrib directory contains example code which may be useful for many. Is
is meant to be a demonstration of good practices and posibilities, but it is
as well as a libary of reusable code.

However, note that you don't have to use anything from the contrib directory.
Right now, contrib expects the hosts to be a debian based system and
deployment scripts for other operating systems may be entirely different.
