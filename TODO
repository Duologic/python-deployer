0. implement __dir__
2. Add dummy text backend to telnet_auth.
3. clean-up logging in standalone shell.
4. add onHost logging for citylive-operations
5. write documentation (sphinx)
6. correct exceptions.
7. Take $TERM from the client terminal. (In case of a fuse-filesystem-system, we can easily have another $TERM for each connection.)
8. test 'hosts' vs. 'host'
9. test Node.node_group is a Group class.
10. test exceptions in action.
12. we should have at least a role named 'host' in SimpleNode
13. Array.Array should not work.
14. When applying map_roles in between two SimpleNode classes, it should be possible to use anything, but you shouldn't be able to override 'host'.
16. It should not be possible to pass a custom Hosts to a SimpleNode when he has a parent.
17. When moving to another thread,  hostcontext should be aware of that. Guarantee thread safety.
18. Implement walk-function
19. don't use __name__ in inspection. use self._node_name instead.
20. implement filesystem in userspace mapping.   (sftp, etc...)
21. update README
22. Rename get and put to get_file and put_file and wrap it around Host.open()
